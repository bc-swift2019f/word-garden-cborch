// 3.4 Notes

// 3.3 Notes
// Implicitly unwrapped optionals
// We are defining something that we know has no value currently but that we are goubg to initialize later before we need it
// - Use ! so say lets just treat it not as optional becuase we know we'll fix it before we use it

// 3.2 Notes
// First responder is the field or area that has first prtioty in collecting key presses or gestures
// Resigning first responder from a fiedl will dismiss the keyboard
// Add the done event from the keyboard done key from an IBAction from the text field
// Editing change IBAction responds to any keypress
// - The action is triggered at every key press
